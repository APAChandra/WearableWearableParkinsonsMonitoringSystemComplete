This is an evolving library to help Wear developers with those tasks that they need to deal with often. Features provided in this library will change over time while backward compatibility will be maintained as much as possible. This library can be added to your project as a module and can be used on your wear or mobile modules, as an added dependency (for certain features, it needs to be added to both).
