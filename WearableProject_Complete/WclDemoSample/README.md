# WclDemoSample
This app uses WearCompanionLibrary. It has both a phone and a wear component. To transfer the db file you have to be on the transfer page on both the mobile and wear app at the same time.

## Dependencies
* [WearCompanionLibrary (WCL)](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-WearCompanionLibrary)
* The phone module also depends on the [design support library](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2015/05/android-design-support-library.html).
* Note: if you follow the instructions below, the WCL library will bring in other dependencies that
  are needed. If you choose to use WCL in a different way (for example using an archive version of
  that library), then you may need to include the dependencies that are listed for WCL as well.
