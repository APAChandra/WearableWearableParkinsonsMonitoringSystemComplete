# WearCompanionLibrary (WCL)
This is an evolving library to help Wear developers with those tasks that they need to deal with often.
Features provided in this library will change over time while backward compatibility will be maintained
as much as possible. This library can be added to your project as a module and can be used on your
wear or mobile modules, as an added dependency (for certain features, it needs to be added to both).

## Dependencies
* google-play-services (wearable) library from the Android SDK (version 8.1+)
* android-support-v7-appcompat (version 23 or above)
* wearable support library (1.2+)

## References and How to report bugs
* A PDF documentation can be found on the root of the project, please read that to get a better
  understanding of how the library works and how it should be set up and used.
* A complete sample app, [WclSampleDemo](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-WclDemoSample)
